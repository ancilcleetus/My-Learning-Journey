        "VGG16 is a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) architecture which was used to win ILSVRC (Imagenet) competition in 2014. It was proposed by the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at the University of Oxford. It is considered to be one of the excellent vision model architecture till date. The pre-trained version of the VGG16 network is trained on over 1 million images from the ImageNet visual database, and is able to classify images into 1,000 different categories with 92.7 % top-5 test accuracy.\n",
