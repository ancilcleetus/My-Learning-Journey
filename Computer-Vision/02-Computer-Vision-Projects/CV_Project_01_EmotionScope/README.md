> **`Note 1`**: Use ![Open in nbviewer](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter%20nbviewer-F37626?logo=jupyter&logoColor=white&style=flat) (recommended) in order to view the jupyter notebooks (nbviewer loads the notebook really fast compared to GitHub). You can see all the codes and the outputs in nbviwer without running the whole code again.

> **`Note 2`**: If you want to edit the notebooks and rerun cells, open notebooks in ![Open in Colab](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Colab-F9AB00?logo=googlecolab&logoColor=white&style=flat).

> **`Note 3`**: It has been observed that sometimes both ![Open in nbviewer](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter%20nbviewer-F37626?logo=jupyter&logoColor=white&style=flat) and ![Open in GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-181717?logo=github&logoColor=white&style=flat) fail to properly render Table of Contents, animations and complex equations for some of the notebooks. In that case, render notebook in ![Open in Colab](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Colab-F9AB00?logo=googlecolab&logoColor=white&style=flat) itself.

## Status of Development:

1. Emotion Classifier Model Generation Notebook ![100%](https://progress-bar.dev/100) [![Open Notebook in GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-181717?logo=github&logoColor=white&style=flat)](CV_Project_01_EmotionScope_Training.ipynb) [![Open Notebook in nbviewer](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter%20nbviewer-F37626?logo=jupyter&logoColor=white&style=flat)](https://nbviewer.org/github/ancilcleetus/My-Learning-Journey/blob/main/Computer-Vision/02-Computer-Vision-Projects/CV_Project_01_EmotionScope/CV_Project_01_EmotionScope_Training.ipynb) [![Open Notebook in Colab](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Colab-F9AB00?logo=googlecolab&logoColor=white&style=flat)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ancilcleetus/My-Learning-Journey/blob/main/Computer-Vision/02-Computer-Vision-Projects/CV_Project_01_EmotionScope/CV_Project_01_EmotionScope_Training.ipynb)
2. Emotion Classifier Model Deployment Notebook ![100%](https://progress-bar.dev/100) [![Open Notebook in GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-181717?logo=github&logoColor=white&style=flat)](CV_Project_01_EmotionScope_Deployment.ipynb) [![Open Notebook in nbviewer](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter%20nbviewer-F37626?logo=jupyter&logoColor=white&style=flat)](https://nbviewer.org/github/ancilcleetus/My-Learning-Journey/blob/main/Computer-Vision/02-Computer-Vision-Projects/CV_Project_01_EmotionScope/CV_Project_01_EmotionScope_Deployment.ipynb) [![Open Notebook in Colab](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Colab-F9AB00?logo=googlecolab&logoColor=white&style=flat)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ancilcleetus/My-Learning-Journey/blob/main/Computer-Vision/02-Computer-Vision-Projects/CV_Project_01_EmotionScope/CV_Project_01_EmotionScope_Deployment.ipynb)
3. [Emotion Classifier Gradio App](https://7dcaa9ee8b97436782.gradio.live/) ![100%](https://progress-bar.dev/100)

> **`Note 1`**: Emotion Classifier Gradio App is not running right now. Demo video of Emotion Classifier Gradio App can be found below. You can run the app by rerunning the Emotion Classifier Model Deployment Notebook in ![Open in Colab](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Colab-F9AB00?logo=googlecolab&logoColor=white&style=flat).

> **`Note 2`**: The App will be deployed in my personal website in the near future.
