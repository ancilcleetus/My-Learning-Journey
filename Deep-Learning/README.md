> **`Note 1`**: Use **Jupyter nbviewer** (recommended) in order to view the jupyter notebooks. You can see all the codes and the outputs in nbviwer without running the whole code again.
> **`Note 2`**: It has been observed that sometimes **Jupyter nbviewer** is unable to properly render complex equations and Table of Contents for some notebooks. In that case, view notebook in GitHub itself.
