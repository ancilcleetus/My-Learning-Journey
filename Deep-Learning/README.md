> **`Note 1`**: Use ![Open in nbviewer](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter%20nbviewer-F37626?logo=jupyter&logoColor=white&style=flat) (recommended) in order to view the jupyter notebooks (nbviewer loads the notebook really fast compared to GitHub). You can see all the codes and the outputs in nbviwer without running the whole code again.

> **`Note 2`**: If you want to edit the notebooks and rerun cells, open notebooks in ![Open in Colab](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Colab-F9AB00?logo=googlecolab&logoColor=white&style=flat).

> **`Note 3`**: It has been observed that sometimes both ![Open in nbviewer](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter%20nbviewer-F37626?logo=jupyter&logoColor=white&style=flat) and ![Open in GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-181717?logo=github&logoColor=white&style=flat) fail to properly render Table of Contents, animations and complex equations for some of the notebooks. In that case, render notebook in ![Open in Colab](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Colab-F9AB00?logo=googlecolab&logoColor=white&style=flat) itself.
