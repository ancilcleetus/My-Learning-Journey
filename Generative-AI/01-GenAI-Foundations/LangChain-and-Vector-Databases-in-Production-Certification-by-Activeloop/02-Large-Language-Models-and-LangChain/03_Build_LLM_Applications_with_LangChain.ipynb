It offers an array of tools, components, and interfaces that simplify the process of creating applications powered by large language models and chat models. LangChain streamlines managing interactions with LLMs, chaining together multiple components, and integrating additional resources, such as APIs and databases. Having gained a foundational understanding of the library in previous lesson, let's now explore various examples of utilizing prompts to accomplish multiple tasks."
