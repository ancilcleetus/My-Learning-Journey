Still, running the mentioned architecture on your local PC is impossible due to the large (7 billion) number of parameters. The authors incorporated two tricks to do efficient fine-tuning and inference. We will focus on inference since the fine-tuning process is out of the scope of this course.\n",

The underlying algorithm that helps with making it happen is called Quantization. It basically converts the pre-trained model weights to 4-bit precision using the GGML format.  So, the model uses fewer bits to represent the numbers. There are two main advantages to using this technique:\n",
