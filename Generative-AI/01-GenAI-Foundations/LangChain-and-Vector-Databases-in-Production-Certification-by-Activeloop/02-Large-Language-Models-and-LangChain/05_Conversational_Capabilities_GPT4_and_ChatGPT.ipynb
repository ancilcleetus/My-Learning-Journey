        "In this lesson, we will explore the benefits of using GPT-4 and ChatGPT, focusing on their ability to maintain context in conversations. We will demonstrate how these advanced language models can remember conversation history and respond accordingly, making them ideal for chat applications. Additionally, we will briefly discuss the improvements in GPT-4, such as longer context length and better generalization. By the end of this lesson, you should be able to understand how GPT-4 and ChatGPT can be used for context-aware chat applications via the API, as opposed to just using the OpenAI ChatGPT webpage.\n",
        "\n",
        "As mentioned before, **OpenAI's GPT-4** represents a significant advancement in the field of large language models. Among its many improvements are enhanced creativity, the ability to process visual input, and an extended contextual understanding. In the realm of conversational AI, both GPT-4 and ChatGPT use the Transformers architecture at their core and are fine-tuned to hold natural dialogue with a user. While the free version of ChatGPT relies on GPT-3.5, the premium offering, ChatGPT Plus, gives access to the more advanced GPT-4 model.\n",
        "\n",
        "The benefits of employing ChatGPT and GPT-4 in chat format are numerous. For instance, GPT-4's short-term memory capacity of 64,000 words greatly surpasses GPT-3.5's 8,000-word limit, enabling it to maintain context more effectively in prolonged conversations. Furthermore, GPT-4 is highly multilingual, accurately handling up to 26 languages, and boasts improved steering capabilities, allowing users to tailor responses with a custom \"personality.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The new model is considerably safer to use, boasting a 40% increase in factual responses and an 82% reduction in disallowed content responses. It can also interpret images as a foundation for interaction ane hence its potential to revolutionize context-aware chat applications is immense."
